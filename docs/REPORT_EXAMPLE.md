## 🤖 LLM Strategic Decisions

**Total Decisions**: 3

- ✅ **Include**: 2
- ⏭️ **Exclude**: 0
- 🔍 **Manual Review**: 1

### Detailed Decisions

#### ✅ PR #120: INCLUDE (HIGH)

**Rationale**: This PR adds critical NULL checks to network handler functions, improving safety with minimal risk. The changes are well-contained and don't affect other components.

**Benefits**:
- Prevents potential NULL pointer dereferences
- Improves overall system stability
- Low risk, isolated changes

**Risks**:
- Minimal - changes are defensive in nature

#### ✅ PR #130: INCLUDE (MEDIUM)

**Requires PRs**: [125]

**Benefits**:
- Standardized logging approach
- Better integration with system monitoring
- Required dependency for security patch

**Risks**:
- Large refactor - needs thorough testing
- May affect log parsing scripts

#### 🔍 PR #135: MANUAL_REVIEW (HIGH)

**Rationale**: Security patch for buffer overflow - critical fix but conflicts with logging changes. Requires manual merge due to complex dependencies.

**Requires PRs**: [130]

**Benefits**:
- Fixes critical security vulnerability
- Improves input validation

**Risks**:
- Conflicts with multiple PRs
- Needs careful integration testing
