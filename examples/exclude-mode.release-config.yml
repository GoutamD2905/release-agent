# RDK-B Bi-Weekly Release — Exclusion Example
# Copy this to your component repo root as: .release-config.yml

# "Take ALL PRs from develop — EXCEPT the ones I list"
# Use when: most PRs are ready, you just need to block a few WIPs

version: "2.4.0"                   # ← release version

base_branch: "develop"             # ← your integration branch (develop/main/master)

# PRs to SKIP — list PR numbers of WIPs or not-ready changes

  - 205   # WIP: new radio driver — not ready
  - 310   # Experimental: mesh refactor — needs more testing
